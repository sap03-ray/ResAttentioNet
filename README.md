# ResAttentioNet
This project proposes ResAttentioNet, a deep learning architecture for emotion recognition from EEG signals. The model integrates:

Residual Temporal Feature Extractor (RTFE) for temporal feature extraction
Multi-Head Temporal Attention Pooling (MTAP) to focus on emotionally salient EEG segments
Emotion Discriminative edc (EDC) for robust classification of emotional states
The model was trained and tested on the following benchmark datasets:

[SEED Dataset](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed.html) — Emotion classification with 3 classes

[SEED-IV Dataset](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed-iv.html) — Emotion classification with 4 classes

[SEED-V Dataset](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed-v.html) — Emotion classification with 5 classes

[SEED-VII Dataset](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed-vii.html) — Emotion classification with 7 classes
